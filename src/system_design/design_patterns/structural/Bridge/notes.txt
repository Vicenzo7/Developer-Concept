Bridge Design Pattern

Bridge Design Pattern decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that the two
can vary independently


Bridge pattern and Strategy pattern are exactly same, the difference is in the intent

Strategy pattern is used when two child classes have same functionality but this functionality
is not present with parent.

Also change the behaviour of the object at run time

and Bridge pattern is used to decouple abstraction from its implementation so that
both can grow independently

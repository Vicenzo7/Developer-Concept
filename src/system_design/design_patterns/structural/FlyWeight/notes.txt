Fly Weight Design Pattern
This pattern helps to reduce memory usage by sharing data among multiple objects.

Two Important Interview Questions
- Design Word Processor i.e. text editor
- Design Game

Observe and understand when to use this pattern
- When memory is limited
- When objects share data
    - Intrinsic data: shared among object and remain same once defined one value.
    - Extrinsic data: changes based on client input and differs from one another.
- Creation of object is expensive.

This is how we solve the issue
- From object remove all extrinsic data and keep intrinsic data(this object is called FlyWeight Object)
- This Flyweight class can be immutable
- Extrinsic Data can be passed to FlyWeight class in method parameters.
- Once the Flyweight object is created it can be cached and reused whenever required

Composite Design Pattern
Design File System/ Design Calculator

Composite Design Pattern comes into picture when there is Object inside an object

1.For Example We are designing a file system

file system can have file or directory.
Directory can have files or directory.

So the above can go on, it becomes a tree like structure

2. Build a calculator with arithmetic expression

=> 2 * (1+7)
so this is also tree like structure

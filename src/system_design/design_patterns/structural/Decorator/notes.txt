Decorator Design Pattern

Use case
1.Pizza-Shop

You can decorate base pizza

((base pizza) + cheese)
(((base pizza) + cheese) + mushroom)
((((base pizza) + cheese) + mushroom) + cheese)


Why we need decorator pattern
-> To prevent class explosion

Example we have a class base pizza

Now this class will be extended by cheese so base pizza + cheese
Now this class will be extended by mushroom so base pizza + cheese + mushroom

So we have to create multiple class also remember, toppings can be used with
permutation and combination.. so that many classes

A class explosion occurs when a software system has a large number of classes,
often beyond what was originally anticipated or well-structured.


Note:

1.The object which we get after decorating the base object, that object can also be
further decorated.
2.Decorator is has-a and also is-a relationship with the base.

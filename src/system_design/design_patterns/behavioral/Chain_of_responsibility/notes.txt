What is Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern

When the client send request and he does not know who will fulfill its request

Example I ask 2000 rs from the atm machine and atm machine has 3 handlers

1. 2000 rs handler
2. 500 rs handler
3. 100 rs handler


request will go to 2000 rs handler, but 2000 rs cannot fulfill this request,
so it sends this request to 500 rs handler, but 500 can fulfill only 1500 as it has
3 notes of 500 so it sends 500 rs request to 100rs handler
